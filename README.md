# College Survival: The Game
This project was created as part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI), an immersive four week summer program for recent high school grads entering a post-secondary program in Computer Science or a releated field of study.

## Description
Sammie is an incoming university student who has no idea what is in store for him. Make your way through the various levels of this 2D platformer to help him learn how to survive as a freshman. Along his journey, help him to collect coins for the laundry machine, but be careful to avoid the random objects that are falling from the sky. Each level has a different theme and a corresponding piece of wisdom.

## How to Play
To control the player: Left and Right Arrow Keys

## Acknowledgements
Our initial idea for the game mechanics came from the classic Donkey Kong arcade game.

The theme was loosely inspired by a sitcom called Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide.

Thank you to the amazing Google mentors who supported us throughout the program, and shout out to Cohort 3!
